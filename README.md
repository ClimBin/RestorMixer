RestorMixer is a novel general-purpose image restoration (IR) model that combines the strengths of multiple architectural paradigms‚Äî**Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)**, **Transformers**, and **Mamba**‚Äîto achieve state-of-the-art performance with high inference efficiency. This project is the official implementation of the paper, *‚ÄúAn Efficient and Mixed Heterogeneous Model for Image Restoration‚Äù*.

## üåü Why RestorMixer?

Image restoration is a critical task for recovering high-quality images from degraded ones, but traditional methods are often task-specific and costly to develop. While recent general-purpose models have shown promise, they often rely on a single or two combined architectures, which limits their ability to handle diverse degradation types effectively. RestorMixer addresses this by strategically fusing these architectures.

## ‚ú® Key Features

  - **Heterogeneous Architecture Fusion**: RestorMixer is the first model to effectively integrate CNN, Mamba, and Transformer architectures into a single, cohesive framework for image restoration.
  - **Multi-Stage Encoder-Decoder**: A hierarchical design processes features at different resolutions, from high-resolution local details to low-resolution global contexts.
  - **Superior Performance**: Achieves leading performance on multiple IR tasks, including deraining, desnowing, and super-resolution, for both single and mixed degradations.
  - **High Inference Efficiency**: The model is designed for speed, ensuring high performance without sacrificing computational efficiency.
  - **Versatility**: This framework is also applicable to other vision tasks (using an encoder-decoder structure).
